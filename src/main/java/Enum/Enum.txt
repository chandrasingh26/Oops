    Enumeration =>
        a special data type that consists of a set of named constants, also known as enum values.

    Ex- collection of days ( i.e. days of week )

        public enum Day {
            SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY
        }

    SOME IMPORTANT POINTS:-
        1. Enum constants are constant and should be written in uppercase letters.
        2. Enums can be used in switch statements.
        3. Enums can implement interfaces.
        4. Enums can't be used to create objects.
