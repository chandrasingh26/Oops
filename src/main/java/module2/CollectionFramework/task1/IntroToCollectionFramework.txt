//  Collection in Java-
        It is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.

//  Collection Framework- (java.util package)
        Represents a unified architecture for storing and manipulating group of objects.

    Hierarchy of Collection Framework-

                                             Iterable
                                                |
                                            Collection
                                                |
            -------------------------------------------------------------------------
            |                                   |                                   |
          List                                 Set                                Queue

    1. List- (duplicate elements, null values, index-based operation)

        a) ArrayList- (fast access, modify slow)

           -> It is dynamic array
           -> Can contain duplicate elements
           -> Maintains insertion order
           arraylist.add() -> for addition of new value
           arraylist.get() -> for getting existing value

        b) LinkedList- (slow access, modify fast)

            -> Can contain duplicate elements
            -> Maintain insertion order
            -> can be used as list, stack and queue ( doubly ll )
            -> can implement stack using ll because stack implements linked list.

        c) Vector- ( same as like ArrayList )

            -> unlike ArrayList, it has capacity checking method ( v.capacity() )
            -> Synchronized (thread-safe)
            -> in vector capacity increases in multiple of 2x by default
            -> we can customize it according to need

        d) Stack- (LIFO, synchronized)

            -> thread safe ( extends Vector )
            -> also can be implemented using linked list ( JCF ll is doubly ll )

        e) CopyOnWriteArrayList- ( Read and Modify at same time )

            -> Thread-Safe – Allows concurrent read operations without locks.
            -> Copy-on-Write Mechanism – Creates a new copy of the list for write operations (add, set, remove).
            -> Good for Read-Heavy Operations – Ideal when reads are frequent and writes are rare.


    2. Set- (unique elements, modification fast )

        a) HashSet- ( stored in unsorted manner, uses Hashing, Fast ( O(1) ) )

            -> Unordered – Does not maintain insertion order.
            -> Allows null Value – But only one null entry is allowed.
            -> Not Thread-Safe – Must be synchronized externally if used in multithreaded environments.
            -> Fast Operations (O(1) for add/remove/contains) – Efficient for searching elements.
            -> No Indexing – Elements cannot be accessed by an index like in ArrayList.

        b) TreeSet- ( stored in sorted manner, uses Red-Black Tree, Slow ( O(log n) ) )

            -> Not Thread-Safe – Use Collections.synchronizedSortedSet() for synchronization.
            -> No null Allowed – Throws NullPointerException if null is inserted.
